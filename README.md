# Essential GamePass w/ Autofill
Essential Game Pass w/ Autofill for Windows 10/11

Hi everyone,

this is my first ever project for hardcore gamers who does not want to go back and forth with remembering account names. It reduces minutes long process of logging in to your game accounts or any supported desktop app into a few clicks away (just like ADC mains). 

This program does not use any data collection or any resource heavy tasks to bug down system when using. I personally was frustrated when i found out there were no way to use my passwords in desktop apps. So i created this app. Personally, i own more than a dozen of accounts for a single game. That makes it harder to login to the account you want every time you want to play that game. With recent token thief cases, it was more appropriate not to save logins to apps.

I am planning to add source code along with support for new features if this takes off. I am also open to new ideas that users want to induce to my app.

To be able to keep the app sustained and supported, I need your support as well. If you guys like to help me out,
